# Autonomous Car Project (RTOS)

This project implements an autonomous car using a Tiva C Series TM4C123 microcontroller. It integrates various sensors, motors, and timers to create a self-driving car capable of obstacle avoidance and real-time data display on an LCD.

This repo. is divided into to projects:
## 1. [Autonomous Car with simple manual non-preemptive scheduler.](https://github.com/username/another-repo).
## 2. [Autonomous Car using freeRTOS.](https://github.com/username/another-repo).
